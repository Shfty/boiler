# Boiler

A GDScript preprocessor aimed at reducing common boilerplate patterns.

## Overview

Boiler aims to reduce common boilerplate patterns by introducing comment-driven preprocessor tags to the standard GDScript syntax.
Implemented as an editor plugin, it watches the currently-edited script for changes, and uses any detected Boiler tags to generate a script_file.gen.gd alongside it.

## Features

- Automatically generate boilerplate code from a simplified set of markup tags
- Integrates directly with the Godot script editor and resource filesystem for seamless code regeneration

## Example Content

`example.tscn` in the `scenes` folder contains several examples of how Boiler can be used to simplify the generation of signals, setters and on-change handler methods.
